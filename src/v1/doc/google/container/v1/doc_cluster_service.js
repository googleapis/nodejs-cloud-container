/**
 * Parameters that describe the nodes in a cluster.
 *
 * @property {string} machineType
 *   The name of a Google Compute Engine [machine
 *   type](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/machine-types) (e.g.
 *   `n1-standard-1`).
 *
 *   If unspecified, the default machine type is
 *   `n1-standard-1`.
 *
 * @property {number} diskSizeGb
 *   Size of the disk attached to each node, specified in GB.
 *   The smallest allowed disk size is 10GB.
 *
 *   If unspecified, the default disk size is 100GB.
 *
 * @property {string[]} oauthScopes
 *   The set of Google API scopes to be made available on all of the
 *   node VMs under the "default" service account.
 *
 *   The following scopes are recommended, but not required, and by default are
 *   not included:
 *
 *   * `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/compute` is required for mounting
 *   persistent storage on your nodes.
 *   * `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/devstorage.read_only` is required for
 *   communicating with **gcr.io**
 *   (the [Google Container Registry](https://cloud.google.com/container-registry/)).
 *
 *   If unspecified, no scopes are added, unless Cloud Logging or Cloud
 *   Monitoring are enabled, in which case their required scopes will be added.
 *
 * @property {string} serviceAccount
 *   The Google Cloud Platform Service Account to be used by the node VMs. If
 *   no Service Account is specified, the "default" service account is used.
 *
 * @property {Object.<string, string>} metadata
 *   The metadata key/value pairs assigned to instances in the cluster.
 *
 *   Keys must conform to the regexp [a-zA-Z0-9-_]+ and be less than 128 bytes
 *   in length. These are reflected as part of a URL in the metadata server.
 *   Additionally, to avoid ambiguity, keys must not conflict with any other
 *   metadata keys for the project or be one of the reserved keys:
 *    "cluster-location"
 *    "cluster-name"
 *    "cluster-uid"
 *    "configure-sh"
 *    "enable-os-login"
 *    "gci-update-strategy"
 *    "gci-ensure-gke-docker"
 *    "instance-template"
 *    "kube-env"
 *    "startup-script"
 *    "user-data"
 *
 *   Values are free-form strings, and only have meaning as interpreted by
 *   the image running in the instance. The only restriction placed on them is
 *   that each value's size must be less than or equal to 32 KB.
 *
 *   The total size of all keys and values must be less than 512 KB.
 *
 * @property {string} imageType
 *   The image type to use for this node. Note that for a given image type,
 *   the latest version of it will be used.
 *
 * @property {Object.<string, string>} labels
 *   The map of Kubernetes labels (key/value pairs) to be applied to each node.
 *   These will added in addition to any default label(s) that
 *   Kubernetes may apply to the node.
 *   In case of conflict in label keys, the applied set may differ depending on
 *   the Kubernetes version -- it's best to assume the behavior is undefined
 *   and conflicts should be avoided.
 *   For more information, including usage and the valid values, see:
 *   https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/labels/
 *
 * @property {number} localSsdCount
 *   The number of local SSD disks to be attached to the node.
 *
 *   The limit for this value is dependant upon the maximum number of
 *   disks available on a machine per zone. See:
 *   https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/disks/local-ssd#local_ssd_limits
 *   for more information.
 *
 * @property {string[]} tags
 *   The list of instance tags applied to all nodes. Tags are used to identify
 *   valid sources or targets for network firewalls and are specified by
 *   the client during cluster or node pool creation. Each tag within the list
 *   must comply with RFC1035.
 *
 * @property {boolean} preemptible
 *   Whether the nodes are created as preemptible VM instances. See:
 *   https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instances/preemptible for more
 *   information about preemptible VM instances.
 *
 * @property {Object[]} accelerators
 *   A list of hardware accelerators to be attached to each node.
 *   See https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/gpus for more information about
 *   support for GPUs.

 *
 * @property {string} diskType
 *   Type of the disk attached to each node (e.g. 'pd-standard' or 'pd-ssd')
 *
 *   If unspecified, the default disk type is 'pd-standard'
 *
 * @property {string} minCpuPlatform
 *   Minimum CPU platform to be used by this instance. The instance may be
 *   scheduled on the specified or newer CPU platform. Applicable values are the
 *   friendly names of CPU platforms, such as
 *   <code>minCpuPlatform: &quot;Intel Haswell&quot;</code> or
 *   <code>minCpuPlatform: &quot;Intel Sandy Bridge&quot;</code>. For more
 *   information, read [how to specify min CPU
 *   platform](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instances/specify-min-cpu-platform)
